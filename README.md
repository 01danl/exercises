# Exercises

This repository contains solutions to programming challenges from various contests and Leetcode exercises. The solutions are organized into two main categories: **Contester Exercises** and **Leetcode Exercises**.

## Structure

- **contester_exercises/**: This directory includes solutions to various competitive programming problems from different coding contests.
  
- **leetcode_exercises/**: This directory contains solutions to Leetcode problems, ranging from easy to hard difficulty.

## Video Solutions

Along with the code, video explanations are provided for many of the problems to help understand the approach, logic, and steps involved in the solution.
