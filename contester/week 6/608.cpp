/*
Write a program that uses your function int countAccurance(char arr[maxn], char ch) to culculate how many times give letter meets int the given sequesnce. Use ะก-style string (without string library).The length of each string is not more that 20 chars.
You have to use developed(written) function N times.

Input:
First line contains N(1<=N<=100).
Then N lines are given in the following format : "one char" a space and that char array.

Output:
N lines in the following format :
< number of occurrence > < letter itself > in < given string >
