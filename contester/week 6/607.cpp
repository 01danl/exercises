/*
Write a program that uses your function int countAccurance(char arr[maxn], char ch) to culculate how many times give letter meets int the given sequesnce. Use ะก-style string (without string library).The length of each string is not more that 20 chars.

Input:
Any time you will be give two chars and two char arrays.

Output:
Have to hold only two lines in the following format:
< number of occurrence > < letter itself > characters in < given string >
